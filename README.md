# Call ChatGPT

Make a regular phone number you can call to talk to ChatGPT.

I'm not telling you my number so you'll have to follow the instructions below if you want to try it live.


## ... But why?

IDK man, it seemed like fun. It's a quintessential "gluing APIs together" project. OpenAI has speech-to-text, chat, and text-to-speech APIs already; I just needed to attach Twilio.

Of course that was before I realized how much pain I was going to have trying to convert the audio streams (`mulaw` to/from Twilio, `mp3` to/from OpenAI). But I got there in the end.

(Pro tip: when trying to convert Twilio's `mulaw` stream with ffmpeg, you need to explicitly specify the sampling frequency explicitly using `-ar 800`, and the `-ar 8000` bit needs to come _before_ the `-i input` parameter in the CLI.)


## Setup

This is a Node.js app.

- Clone the repo.
- Ensure you have `node` set up.
- `npm install` to get dependencies.

You need to be able to expose a port on your machine to the wider internet. [Tailscale funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel/) works well if you have Tailscale set up already, or alternatively Twilio's docs suggest [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). The code assumes you'll have a domain name which allows connections over the standard port (443), which either of the previously-mentioned services will provide; if that's not the case for you the code will require tweaking.

- Put your domain name in a file named `DOMAIN.txt` in this directory.

You need a Twilio account with a phone number. They have a pretty generous free trial which is sufficient for demo purposes (at 2Â¢/minute, the $15 trial credit goes a long way).

- In the Twilio console, configure the phone number so that under "Voice Configuration" -> "A call comes in" you have "webhook" with URL is "https://your-domain-here.net/voice", where `your-domain-here` is the domain mentioned in the previous part.

You need an OpenAI account, with billing enabled.

- Get (or create) an API key from [this page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and save it in a file named 'OPENAI_KEY.txt' in this directory.

Finally you need ffmpeg.

- Install ffmpeg and ensure it's on your path.


## Use

`node call.js` will run the app and wait for your webhook on port 3000. Make sure you're running `Tailscale funnel` or whatever so that the wider internet can talk to that port.

Then call the number and just talk. You'll need to wait 3 seconds after speaking for it to recognize that you're done and start responding, and responses themselves will also take a couple seconds to begin.
